# TestReporter
To be used in place of built in Unit Testing Functionality in C# Visual Studio, creates a report file so can be printed easily or added into documentation.

Tired of Visual Studio Unit Testing not producing an output file easily? I was! So I created something really quickly that would allow me to test Equality and Non-Equality, and automatically produce the report once the specified tests had been completed. It is only a simple program at the moment,  but it could be extended to apportion issues to the right people, etc, so that work can be made more efficient!
